# Problem 1

This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a
control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is
included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and
arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files
function will help Iterate over file names and read in data for each
subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the
dataframe Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm
and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any
other tidying that’s necessary Make a spaghetti plot showing
observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences
between groups.

# Problem 2

The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository. Let’s
load in the raw dataset:

``` r
wp_homicides_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicides =
  read_csv(wp_homicides_url,
           col_types = c("c", "c", "c", "c", "c", "n", "c", "c", "c", "d", "d", "c")) %>% # Read in the raw csv dataset
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         reported_date = as.character(reported_date),
         reported_date = as.Date(reported_date, "%Y%m%d")) # Change variable types for `reported_date` and `age`
```

### Describing the raw data

The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository.

The raw `homicides` dataset from the Washington Post contains 52179
rows/observations and 12 columns/variables. Each of the 52179 rows
represents a homicide. The 12 key variables in this dataset include:
uid, reported_date, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age,
victim_sex, city, state, lat, lon, disposition:

-   `uid` – a unique ID for each observation
-   `reported_date` – the reported date of each homicide (yearmonthday)
-   `victim_last` and `victim_first` – the last and first name of each
    homicide victim
-   Demographic information for each homicide victim, including their
    race (`victim_race`), age (`victim_age`), sex (`victim_sex`)
-   The location of each homicide incident, including the `city` and
    `state` as well as the latitude and longitude (`lat` and `lon`)
-   `disposition` – the status of each homicide case (case closed/open
    and arrest status)

### Homicides numbers and unsolved homicides by city

Now, let’s create a `city_state` variable combining the `city` and
`state` variables (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize within
cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of
unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without
arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

Below is a table showing the total number of homicides and the number of
unsolved homicides in each city. These values were also saved to a new
dataframe called `homicides_by_city`.

``` r
homicides = homicides %>%
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "))

homicides_by_city = homicides %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarise(n_homicides = length(city_state),
            n_unsolved = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")))

homicides_city_table = homicides_by_city %>%
  knitr::kable(col.names = c('City, State', 'Number of Homicides', 'Number Unsolved'))
  
homicides_city_table
```

### Estimating the proportion of unsolved homicides in Baltimore, MD

Below, I use the `prop.test` function to estimate the proportion of
homicides that are unsolved in the city of Baltimore, MD. The output of
prop.test is saved as a tidy dataframe called `unsolved_balt`.

``` r
unsolved_balt = homicides_by_city %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>%
  select(n_homicides, n_unsolved)

unsolved_balt = prop.test(x = unsolved_balt$n_unsolved,
                          n = unsolved_balt$n_homicides) %>%
                broom::tidy()
```

From this new dataframe `unsolved_balt`, we pull the values for the
estimated proportion and 95% CI of unsolved homicides in Baltimore using
inline R:

-   **The estimated proportion of unsolved homicides in Baltimore, MD is
    0.6456 (95% CI: 0.6276, 0.6632)**

### Estimating the proportion of unsolved homicides for all 50 cities

Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract
both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval
for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map,
purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy
dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.

``` r
unsolved_all = homicides_by_city
```

### Plot of unsolved homicide estimates & CIs for major cities in the US

Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out
geom_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower
limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved
homicides.

# Problem 3

When designing an experiment or analysis, a common question is whether
it is likely that a true effect will be detected – put differently,
whether a false null hypothesis will be rejected. The probability that a
false null hypothesis is rejected is referred to as power, and it
depends on several factors, including: the sample size; the effect size;
and the error variance. In this problem, you will conduct a simulation
to explore power in a one-sample t-test.

First set the following design elements:

Fix n=30 Fix σ=5 Set μ=0. Generate 5000 datasets from the model

x∼Normal\[μ,σ\]

For each dataset, save μ̂ and the p-value arising from a test of H:μ=0
using α=0.05. Hint: to obtain the estimate and p-value, use broom::tidy
to clean the output of t.test.

Repeat the above for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6}, and complete the following:

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power. Make a plot
showing the average estimate of μ̂ on the y axis and the true value of μ
on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average
estimate of μ̂ only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y
axis and the true value of μ on the x axis. Is the sample average of μ̂
across tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the
true value of μ? Why or why not?
